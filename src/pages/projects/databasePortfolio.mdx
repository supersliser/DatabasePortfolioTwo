**This website is dedicated to storing all of the various projects I've worked on in an easily accessible format.**

## Inspiration

The layout and design of this website was inspired by the website for the media production group ASD (Andromeda Software Development). You can view their official website by clicking [here](http://www.asd.gr/#the_legend_of_sisyphus).

However, I found that this website layout did not allow me to properly showcase my various portfolio items, such that I looked at other layouts such as the portfolio for Dr. Rehan Zia. His website can be found [here](https://www.rehanzia.net/). This website features a similar basic layout but makes it easier to express a document.

Despite this new design, I found that there was one major issue, specifically an issue with larger pages. The issue was that these pages became rather difficult to navigate as they could be rather long. While trying to figure out a solution to this concern, I remembered a feature of Markdown files, the existance of headings. I also noticed the Astro Docs which featured a similar navigation as you will see on the desktop version of this site and decided to leverage this.

## Technologies

This site is developed using [Astro](https://astro.build/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) & elements of [React](https://react.dev/) to then deployed on [vercel](https://vercel.com/home)
