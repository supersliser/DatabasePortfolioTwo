**This project was developed as a part of my university degree at [Bournemouth University](https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/study/courses/ba-hons-computer-animation-visual-effects).**

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to generate a 3D model of 1 of 6 given statues in [Maya](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview?mktvar002=3466774|SEM|15984960873|135583738507|kwd-11205246&utm_source=GGL&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=GGL_M-E_Maya_EMEA_GB_Visits_SEM_BR_New_EX_0006_3466774&utm_id=3466774&utm_term=kwd-11205246&gclsrc=aw.ds&&)

The statue I chose was named [Kritios Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kritios_Boy)

## Process

The initial layout was developed using a process known as "blocking out" the main shape. This base model was then sculpted further using Maya's own sculpting tools.
