This was a research project for Bournemouth University. The project was to assist a startup Company called Safehouse Pro in the development of their web app.

## The Company

Safehouse Pro is a startup company which aims to provide a platform for the public to access information regarding personal and civil preparedness.

Their website is accessible at [safehousepro.com](https://safehousepro.co.uk).

## Development

The development of this site was split into 4 main legs:

- [Basic Site Development](#Basic-Site-Development)
- [My Safety Page](#My-Safety-Page)
- [Questionnaire](#Questionnaire)
- [Information sharing](#Information-sharing)

### Basic Site Development

The basic site was created using WordPress. This enabled the developers to focus on the functionality of the site and allow the design to be figured out easily.

The site features sections with regular updates:

- A news section which is updated with the latest news from Safehouse Pro.

- A reports section which is updated with the latest reports from Safehouse Pro and associated partners.

- An RSS feed which is updated which aggregates personal and civil preparedness news from other reliable sources.

All of this is handled by WordPress to allow the content admins to easily update the site without needing to know how to code.

### Information sharing

The main purpose of the site is to inform the public with information regarding personal and civil preparedness. This is done through a series of pages which provide information on various topics.

These pages are developed using simple Markdown files which are then converted to HTML and displayed on the site. This allows the content admins to easily update the information without needing to know how to code while also allowing strong control over formatting and layout to optimise ease of use for searing and reading.

### My Safety Page

This page would provide a dashboard that would take the users current location (or manually entered postcode) and access various governmental and national api's to provide accurate safety information such as flooding, crime rates and the nearest hospital / pharmacy.

### Questionnaire

As a part of the research of the company, they created a report based on a questionnaire. Afterwards, they wanted to repeat this questionnaire. I came back with the idea to make the questionnaire live on the site and allow people to constantly access it. The data could then be filtered temporally and used to generate graphs for future reports.

This required the creation of a custom WordPress plugin which would allow the questionnaire to be created and managed from within the WordPress admin panel. The plugin would also handle the storage of the questionnaire responses in a MySQL database.
