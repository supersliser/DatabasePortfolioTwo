Media Center is a program designed to bring together various streaming services into one place. It is designed to be a one-stop-shop for all your media needs, allowing you to watch movies, TV shows, and listen to music from various streaming services without having to switch between different apps.

The program is build in C++ using QT. The main concept is to allow users to log into their streaming services, then use the [TMDB](./TMDBLib) to access the streaming link for a given movie or TV show. Then allowing users to see whatever they want to watch and all the places it is available to be watched.
