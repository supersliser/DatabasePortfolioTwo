## Process

### Blender Modelling

The first step was to generate the base mesh, this was imported into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Where the softwares sculpt tools were used to give more definition to extremities and create a sense of "sharpness" about the face and body.

### Substance Texturing

The next step was to export the model to [Adobe Substance Painter](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d/apps/painter.html?sdid=JZBJVTGW&mv=search&mv2=paidsearch&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3ZayBhDRARIsAPWzx8r_yq2Seq2_hHGmwy8_jZE7jfcrpixWIDVmN9RJXbS8_mlNUO3MlRoaAkoREALw_wcB) so that it could be UVed and Textured. I chose to focus on the makeup of the face with this project.

### Rigging

A lesser-known software called [Accurig](https://actorcore.reallusion.com/auto-rig/accurig) was then used to generate a skeleton for this character, after which it was exported to [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/uk/products/maya/free-trial) to be converted to a fully functional rig

### Animation

Maya was also used to generate the animation keyframes

### Clothing

The animation was then exported to [Marvelous Designer](Marvelous Designer) where the model had its costume designed and animated using the software's own physics system.

### Groom

Finally, the model was exported to [SideFX Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/) where it the software's own hair system was used, after which the model was also rendered in Houdini using the Mantra engine.
