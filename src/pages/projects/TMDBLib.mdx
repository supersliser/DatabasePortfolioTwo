This is a C++ library designed to provide access to the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. It is built using the QT framework and is designed to be cross-platform, allowing it to be used on both Windows and Linux.

## Usage

It implements 2 ways of accessing the API:

- Synchronous: This is the traditional way of accessing the API, where the program waits for a response before continuing. This is useful for simple applications where the user does not need to interact with the program while waiting for a response.
- Asynchronous: This is a more advanced way of accessing the API, where the program does not wait for a response before continuing. This allows the user to interact with the program while waiting for a response, making it more responsive and user-friendly. This is the preferred approach especially for GUI systems.
