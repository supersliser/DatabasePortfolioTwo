This is a program designed to help make decisions.

You've no doubt heard of a "pros and cons list", or the "yellow legal pad" system from How I Met Your Mother. It's essentially the idea that any decision can be made logically by listing out all the positive aspects and the negative aspects of a given decision. Any business people around you will likely call this a "cost-benefit analysis".

> Essentially, this is a purpose built excel spreadsheet.

## Development

The program is built in C++ using the QT framework. It is designed to be cross-platform, and has been tested on both Windows and Linux.

It is also an experiment in DevOps, using GitHub Actions to automate the build process for both Windows and Linux. This allows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), ensuring that the latest version of the program is always available.

Finally, it uses test driven development (TDD) to ensure that the program is robust and reliable. This means that tests are written before the code, ensuring that the code meets the requirements and behaves as expected. The tests are performed using QT's own testing framework.
