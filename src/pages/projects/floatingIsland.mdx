**This is an improvement upon my previous [procedural forest program](./forest), this time applied on a procedurally generated floating island. All still within [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).**

The island itself is generated by applying a boolean method to a collection of randomly placed cylinders.

<MDXImage src={Island1} alt="This image is the first iteration of the island using cubes rather than cylinders with no smoothing." />

<MDXImage src={Island2} alt="This second iteration features smoothing" />

<MDXImage src={Island3} alt="This 3rd iteration features trees" />

<MDXImage src={Island4} alt="This final iteration uses Cylinders to make it appear much more rounded and natural" />
