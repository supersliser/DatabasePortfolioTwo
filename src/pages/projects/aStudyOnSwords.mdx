This was a research project for Bournemouth University, this project was supposed to act as a simulation of the pre-visualisation task before beginning a project.

<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
<p>Action and Adventure is one of the largest Genre’s within the
Cinematic world in terms of Box Office return <span class="citation"
data-cites="3"></span>. Furthermore, Adventure can be found in the top 3
of all major gaming platforms <span class="citation"
data-cites="4"></span>. As such, it makes sense to analyse the core of
these genres, weaponry. In this article, I intend to focus upon melee
weaponry as I find that these offer a healthy balance between animation
potential, efficiency to craft and creative possibility. Specifically, I
intend to study the various versions of the sword, due to the well
established symbolism associated with the various types of within the
current media.</p>
<p>The idea of blades being able to invoke a specific view or feeling is
well established within the media world, to the point where the mere
concept of a sword and its apparent popularity within media is itself
constructed by the media. Within historical times (I will largely be
referring to the Medieval era), swords were pretty much exclusively
wielded by kings and rulers because of the fact that they were
exclusively tools for fighting and served no secondary purpose. Thus,
they were extremely rare and more commonly symbolic rather than a common
use tool which everyone would have known how to use.</p>
<p>Within this, it is my intention to establish a set of symbolisms that
a given weapon can portray, and then use photography to successfully
capture these symbolic features. Thus, allowing me to reproduce such
work in Computer Graphics that would allow swords to contribute actively
to the narrative, as a posed to being passive actors. This means I wish
for swords to be able to contribute to a scene in their own right,
without the outside influence of other factors such as a character or
location. The weapon will, itself, be an actor within the scene which
contributes to the narrative.</p>
<p>All swords can be broken down into 3 basic components:</p>
<div class="list">
<p><span>-</span></p>
<p>A sharp blade which will be used to strike against targets / parry
incoming attacks. (see figure <a href="#fig:SwordBlade"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:SwordBlade">1</a>).</p>
<p>An optional cross guard which blocks an incoming strike from hitting
the hand of the wielder. Sometimes also referred to as a handguard or
crossbar. (see figure <a href="#fig:SwordCross"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:SwordCross">2</a>).</p>
<p>A handle with a size relative to the size of the blade - in units of
the size of the hand of a human. (see figure <a href="#fig:SwordHandle"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:SwordHandle">4</a>).</p>

</figure>

</figure>
<p>The sword blade can feature one sharpened edge or two. The two-sided
blade offers an obvious offensive advantage because of the added
flexibility of its attack. But, this must be balanced with the idea that
the blade will therefore require double the maintenance to ensure the
blade is properly sharpened, as well as also requiring the blade to be
wider. When an object cuts, it uses the sharpened section of the blade
to initially separate the object. The width of the blade is then used to
push the two new parts further apart and ensure a full cut. This then
maximizes blood loss and therefore damage to the target. The effect of
blood loss can then be exemplified by placing a small slit in the centre
of the blade for blood to run down (see figure <a href="#fig:swordSlit"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:swordSlit">8</a>).</p>

<h1 id="media">Swords in the media</h1>
<p>As mentioned in section <a href="#intro" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="intro">1</a>, Films and Video Games that feature melee
weaponry are often some of the most popular. Here I will go over a few
and their use of these weapons:</p>
<h2 id="for-honor">For Honor</h2>
<p>(). For Honor is a multiplayer fighting game known for its mechanics
around stances, allowing any character to hold their weapon in one of
three possible stances. An important thing to note for this game is the
idea that the weapons are specific to a character - a character who
supposedly has specific training, holds specific armour and has specific
abilities. This, therefore, implies that these weapons are a part of the
characters identity and representation the same as any other aspect.
This then presents the idea that weaponry is capable of expressing a
specific idea or symbolism, an idea that is found throughout other
media.</p>
<h2 id="the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h2>
<div class="wrapfigure">
<p><span>r</span><span>0.25</span> <I src={ImperialSword}
style="width:25.0%" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>(). Skyrim is a Role Playing Game set in a fantasy setting of its
namesake - within the world of Tamreil. This game features multiple
different types of sword including the sword, longsword and greatsword.
However, I feel the most important to note is the first sword
encountered by the player in the game - the Imperial sword. At the
beginning of the game, the player is given a choice to join either the
imperial legion or the stormcloak rebellion. The given weapon of the
stormcloaks is an axe - typically associated with Viking culture and a
brutish mentality which then helps to contrast against the weapon given
by joining the imperials, which then helps to give an impression of
legality and structure. Such being the common representation of the
sword.</p>
<h2 id="lotr">The Lord of the Rings</h2>
<p>(). The Lord of the Rings is both a book and film series set in a
medieval fantasy world. Being the generic conventions of the fantasy
genre, these feature many different types of swords and blades. The most
notable being the dagger held by Bilbo - one of the few magical weapons
in the series as well as the longsword held by Aragorn.</p>
<figure id="fig:Sting">
<I src={Sting} style="width:50.0%" alt="The blade

<figcaption><span class="citation" data-cites="Sting"></span> The blade
"Sting" from the film "The Hobbit" glowing in the presence of

</figure>
<h2 id="pirates-of-the-caribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</h2>
<p>() The Pirates of the Caribbean is a film series following the
exploits of pirate Jack Sparrow and the other pirates and sailors he
encounters on his journeys. These feature 2 main types of sword, the
sabre and rapier. There is a running joke within the series that
concerns a particular sword: A rapier produced by the character William
Turner for the Commodore James Norrington. The joke runs that anyone who
sees the sword and has a chance to examine it states "nice sword" before
taking it. This aligns with the representation of the rapier being an
example of regality.</p>

<figure id="fig:potcSword">

<figcaption><span class="citation" data-cites="potcsword"></span>The

Norrington</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="how-i-met-your-mother">How I met your Mother</h2>
<p>() The show how I met your mother is comedy series in which the
protagonist Ted Mosby tells the story of how he met his mother to his
children. The comedy series may appear to be a strange choice for this,
however, this show features 2 sabres which are decorative items hung on
the wall of their flat. This fits the general symbolic association of
the sabre, that it is a largely decorative piece. However, in the Season
1, Episode 8, entitled "The Duel", Ted and his friend Marshall actually
use these swords to duel <span class="citation"
data-cites="theduel"></span>, such that they fulfil Chekhov’s Gun <span
class="citation" data-cites="delaney1990chekhov"></span> and allow these
weapons to generate their own symbolism through their use, that of their
own friendship.</p>
<h2 id="ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</h2>
<p>() Ghostrunner is a fast-paced game in which a cyborg wielding a
katana must run through a cyberpunk city while slashing at enemies with
guns. This game is an expert at presenting the katana and showing its
intended use. The concept of the katana is that it can be swung fast and
allows for quick movement - almost a merge between the rapier and the
longsword. Although it is worth noting that this representation from
Ghostrunner is largely due to the way that the weapon is wielded and
used in the game, rather than its design and structure. However,
recognising this is still useful for the establishment of a base case,
from which my own research can build from.</p>
<h2 id="ahsoka">Ahsoka</h2>
<p>() Ahsoka was a series set in the marvel universe, following the
journey of Ahsoka Tano after the events of order 66. The character of
Ahsoka can be seen to hold 2 separate types of lighsaber - which each
have a comparable type of sword. In 1 hand she holds what is referred to
as a "shinto-blade", a lightsaber equivalent of a shortsword. As well as
a normal lightsaber, the equivalent of a longsword. She holds an
extremely acrobatic style of fighting with these 2, allowing herself to
act more defensively from 1 hand and more offensively from the other.
Overall, balancing the drawbacks of 1 blade with the positives of
another.</p>
<p>The show also features an antagonist named Baylan Skoll. This
character wields a large lightsaber which is treated with the same
fighting style of a greatsword. This contrast of Ahsoka’s agility
against this type of weapon is excellent at displaying the various
representations of weapons as Ashoka uses short quick attacks while
dodging out of the way of Baylan’s strong attacks while he himself
blocks Ahsoka’s own attacks.</p>
<h1 id="iterations-of-sword-symbolism">Iterations of Sword
Symbolism</h1>
<h2 id="Iteration1">Iteration of dull sabres</h2>

<figcaption></figcaption>
<p>The first 2 blades featured in figures <a href="#fig:Iteration1.1"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:Iteration1.1">18</a> and
<a href="#fig:Iteration12" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Iteration12">20</a> features a dull, steel-like
metal blade with 2 sharp edges, a basic circular hand guard and an
uninteresting handle. These weapons are not being held in any way. As a
result, these blades are rather unimpressive such that they fail to
convey any particular element of story or narrative - such being my
final goal. The only characteristic these blades could be said to have
is a slight damage to the blade, suggesting age or lack of care. Thus
the blade is unable to present a narrative or function as a narrative
device. To improve, the blades should feature some form of interesting
shape, colouring or iconography.</p>
<h2 id="Iteration2">Iteration of an engraved sabre</h2>
<figure id="fig:Iteration22">

<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The images in figures <a href="#fig:Iteration21"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:Iteration21">21</a> and
<a href="#fig:Iteration22" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Iteration22">23</a> are arguably the inverse of the
iteration in section <a href="#Iteration1" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="Iteration1">3.1</a> in terms of the presence of
iconography. The blade features a dragon as a cross guard and a lions
head on the end of the handle. There is also a paragraph of inscription
on the blade as well as many pieces of iconographic art decorating the
blade. All of which creates an overwhelmingly regal appearance. It is
obvious that this weapon was only meant to be simply a display piece.
This is one of my issues with it. Chekhov’s Gun <span class="citation"
data-cites="delaney1990chekhov"></span> suggests that a gun featured in
a scene should be fired. Thus, it follows that a sword in a scene must
be used in a battle. This blade not being able to be used in battle
would therefore limit its narrative potential to an extreme level as it
is unable to be used in a battle, and therefore cannot actively
contribute to the narrative, only passively. My goal being weapons that
can be used to add to the narrative in their own right, requires weapons
that can, in fact, add to the scene.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I feel that while the elaborate design is successful in
adding a regal element to the blade, it is simply too much. The dragon
and lion plus the paragraph plus the patterns on the blade is simply too
much. It overwhelms the eye which in turn, would cause it to be less
effective at conveying narrative in animation - a visual medium.</p>
<p>Overall, what can be learned from this iteration is that the weapon
must appear actively useful for fighting and combat, as well not being
too visually overwhelming. It must be sensible in its design while still
being interesting.</p>
<h2 id="Iteration3">Iteration of a damaged blade</h2>
<figure id="fig:Iteration32">

<p>Figures <a href="#fig:Iteration31" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Iteration31">24</a> and <a href="#fig:Iteration32"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:Iteration32">26</a> are
much closer to achieving my goals. The blade itself features damage to
the shape, allowing the silhouette to be effected, this is probably the
most obvious narrative element of the blade, showing age and use. The
colouration of the blade is also additive to the overall narrative
appeal of the weapon as its damage furthers the concept of age and well
use. Overall, the blade is very good at displaying a narrative concept
within its own right.</p>
<h2 id="Iteration4">Iteration of carved longswords</h2>
<figure id="fig:Iteration42">
<figure id="fig:Iteration41">
<I src={Iteration41} style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure id="fig:Iteration42">
<I src={Iteration42} style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"></figcaption>
</figure>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The images in figure <a href="#fig:Iteration4"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Iteration4">[fig:Iteration4]</a> are from 2 separate
stone carvings. Figure <a href="#fig:Iteration41"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:Iteration41">27</a> is
from a larger than life statue (around 9 feet tall) while figure <a
href="#fig:Iteration42" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Iteration42">29</a> is a minifigure in a
nativity-esque crucifixion scene. I believe the fact that both statues
feature longswords being held by a character (both slanting slightly to
the left) would allow itself to create a narrative concept. The fact
that the blade is being held means it does not lack the effects of
Chekhov’s Gun <span class="citation"
data-cites="delaney1990chekhov"></span> as it is still being used in an
active situation (even if not being fought with, it is an active element
in the scene). Keeping it in the scabbard would allow it to present the
idea of potential, the mystery acting as a hermeneutic code <span
class="citation" data-cites="barthes1972semiotics"></span> which is an
advanced narrative technique to keep an audience interested in the
potential of a narrative by obscuring information.</p>
<p>Another strong feature of this iteration is the use of the various
associations of the longsword. The longsword holds a symbolism of honour
and strength. Thus, the sword being wielded by a religious figure or
knight in the presence of Christ would contribute greatly to the overall
intention of the sculptures (such intention being to imply the strength
and power of Christ). The fact that these stand-alone pieces of art are
using weapons in the same ways that I have described previously to
present this representation and interpretation is immensely powerful and
important for helping to prove my goal of allowing weapons to contribute
to a narrative in ways other than simply slicing and damaging
opponents.</p>
<p>The only downside of these pieces is that they are indeed carved from
stone rather than forged of metal. Thus meaning that they are struggling
to inform the creation of materials to provide narrative clarity.
However, other iterations (mainly section <a href="#Iteration2"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="Iteration2">3.2</a>) more than
compensate for this, providing information to help rectify this
otherwise singular lacking in this iteration.</p>
<p>Overall I feel that this iteration is incredibly strong despite its
lack of material diversity, as it shows the generic symbolism of the
chosen weapon in action, allowing it to clearly present the concepts
associated with it. Furthermore, it works with advanced narrative
theories to help build its narrative strength. Overall, creating a
rather useful example to demonstrate the ability of blades to contribute
to the narrative of an art piece.</p>
<h2 id="Iteration5">Iteration of the Holy Longsword</h2>
<figure id="fig:HolyLongsword">
<p><I src={HolyLongsword} style="width:50.0%"
alt="image" /> <span id="fig:HolyLongsword"
label="fig:HolyLongsword"></span></p>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The drawing in figure <a href="#fig:HolyLongsword"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:HolyLongsword">30</a>
features the handle and crossguard of a longsword. The handle features a
split to separate where 2 hands should be placed while wielding the
weapon. Furthermore, the pummel of the handle and the cross feature a
pattern commonly found on a catholic cross, with the overall shape and
relative proportions of the handle and cross work to further this
iconography of that of a catholic cross. This representation of religion
works exceptionally well when combined with the common associations with
that of a longsword as both have the capacity to represent strength and
power, as well as honour. Thus making this quite a useful piece to
analyse in relation the narrative capabilities of a weapon. The active
capabilities of the longsword - that the weapon offers a balance between
offence and defence - is further exemplified by the separator on the
handle, such that the weapon is clearly designed to be wielded by 2
hands. This approach would offer more strength while fighting but would
prohibit the use of a shield. Thus, requiring the wielder to put their
whole faith in their sword, such making it appear extremely strong. This
clear representation in such subtle details is incredibly useful and
powerful within the narrative, thus helping to demonstrate methods in
which a blade is able to strongly contribute to the narrative.</p>

<p>The figure <a href="#fig:Iteration7" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Iteration7">[fig:Iteration7]</a> is in fact
demonstrating two possible states of a magical dagger. Figure <a
href="#fig:Iteration7.1" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Iteration7.1">31</a> shows the dagger in its
pre-thrust state, while figure <a href="#fig:Iteration7.2"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:Iteration7.2">33</a> shows
the dagger post-thrust. The concept behind it is that the weapon will
change shape after "tasting" blood such that when it is removed from the
target, the zigzag shape of the blade will give the same effect as that
of teeth on a blade, dealing more damage to the opponent <span
class="citation" data-cites="kvietkova2015effect"></span>. This weapon
design is very interesting as I have not touched the concept of magical
weapons much as of yet (except in section <a href="#lotr"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lotr">2.3</a>). The concept of
magic fits extremely well with the dagger as well as the concepts of
bloodiness and danger, thus this weapon works quite well to contribute
to the narrative. However, the pitfall of this is that its effect is
dependent on its use. This essentially means that its ability to
contribute to the narrative is dependent upon an actor’s own
contribution to the narrative. A member of the audience would not be
able to gleam anything about the events of the story from the dagger,
without its use by another person. Therefore, while the concept of the
weapon is highly intriguing, it ultimately fails in its ability to
actively contribute to a narrative.</p>
