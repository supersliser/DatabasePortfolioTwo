**Steven is a bird created in only 1 hour and a half. He was created in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and textured in [Adobe Substance Painter](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d/apps/painter.html?sdid=JZBJVTGW&mv=search&mv2=paidsearch&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3ZayBhDRARIsAPWzx8r_yq2Seq2_hHGmwy8_jZE7jfcrpixWIDVmN9RJXbS8_mlNUO3MlRoaAkoREALw_wcB)**

He was generated by using spline modelling to create a base mesh, then rigged manually in Blender.
