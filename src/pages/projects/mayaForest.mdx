# {frontmatter.title}

**This project was developed as a part of my university degree at [Bournemouth University](https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/study/courses/ba-hons-computer-animation-visual-effects).**

## Purpose

The goal of this task was to create a python script for [Maya](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview?mktvar002=3466774|SEM|15984960873|135583738507|kwd-11205246&utm_source=GGL&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=GGL_M-E_Maya_EMEA_GB_Visits_SEM_BR_New_EX_0006_3466774&utm_id=3466774&utm_term=kwd-11205246&gclsrc=aw.ds&&) that could automate a task. I chose to use this script to generate a tree, which was then expanded to generate an entire forest.

## Development Process

To view the full design document and reflection click [here](https://livebournemouthac-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s5605187_bournemouth_ac_uk/EXNiz9ogdGdKpfzH379-C9ABbu7HssbCg-yAah3BdJs_zg?e=qeZNzt).

Terrain generation uses an extremely primitive method in which each point is randomly moved up or down by a random amount within a given amplitude (Parameter Terrain Amplitude). This terrain serves as the base parent of all other objects generated by the program.

Tree generation uses a form of recursion similar to the concept of an L-System but less abstract. It works from a system of recursion levels in which all objects are multiplied by an amount that decreases by a given amount. As this multiplier decreases, the chance of a branch generating leaves rather than further branches increases until the number of recursions reaches a pre-determined maximum level. At this point it is certain that leaves will be generated rather than branches (leaves act as a base case for the recursion as they do not create other items).

Grass also follows a similar sweeping method to trees however does not follow the recursion system used by the tree, rather a polynomial iterative method in which a single blade of grass is combined with 4 others about a circle to generate a ‘clump’. This clump is then placed at random points generated along the terrain.

## Try it yourself

If you would like to run this code yourself, it can be accessed (along with the files it requires) [here](https://github.com/supersliser/MayaForest). *Note: to run the program properly, run it inside of the tree.mb file.*
