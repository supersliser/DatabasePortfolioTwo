**This project was developed as a part of my course at [[Bournemouth University]](https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/).**

## Goal

The purpose of the project was to introduce me to C++ and SDL2. The program was designed to be able to paint to a canvas and export this as a file, similar to [Microsoft Paint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/paint).

The project uses an object oriented approach, with many techniques from other drawing capable systems, such as line interpolation rather than pixel colouring from Microsoft Onenote.

To view the code and run it yourself (makefile included) find the Github repo [here](https://github.com/supersliser/DrawingProject).
