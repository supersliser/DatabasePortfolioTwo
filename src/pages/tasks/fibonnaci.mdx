## Explanation

The Fibonnaci Sequence is a mathematical sequence of numbers defined by fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).

This is to say that for any given number in the Fibonnaci sequence, that number is the sum of the previous 2 numbers.

The first 10 numbers are as follows:
- 0
- 1
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 5
- 8
- 13
- 21
- 34

The Fibonnaci Sequence is famous for being a test of a programmers ability to optimise an algorithm as there are 2 possible methods. The recursive method with an efficiency of O(n) = 2^n and the iterative method with an efficiency of O(n) = n (read more about optimising alogorithms [here](../guides/algorithms#optimisation)).

## Task
Your task is to write a function which takes a number and calculates the nth Fibonnaci number using the recursive method.

> Test Input: 7, expected output: 8

<CodeBlock client:load>
```cpp
int fibonacci_recursive(int n) {
    // Base cases: if n is 0 or 1, return n
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    // Recursive case: sum of the two preceding numbers
    else {
        return fibonacci_recursive(n - 1) + fibonacci_recursive(n - 2);
    }
}
```

## Extension
Your task is to write a function which takes a number and calculates the nth Fibonnaci number using the iterative method.

<CodeBlock client:load>
```cpp
unsigned long long fibonacci(int n) {
    // Handle the base cases
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;

    // Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    unsigned long long a = 0;
    unsigned long long b = 1;
    unsigned long long fib = 0;

    // Calculate the nth Fibonacci number iteratively
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        fib = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = fib;
    }

    return fib;
}
```
